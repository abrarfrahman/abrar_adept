## Summary Document: Workflow Dashboard Implementation

### Features Added:
1. **Workflow Picker**: Users can select between two workflows: "Sample Workflow 1" and "Sample Workflow 2".
2. **Date Picker**: Users can pick a date to filter workflow runs based on the selected date.
3. **Search Functionality**: Users can search for workflow runs by their IDs or error messages.
4. **Card with Failed Runs**: Displays failed workflow runs for a selected date.
5. **Card Overall**: Provides summary statistics including the most high-usage date, slowest workflow run, longest workflow run, overall number of calls, and other relevant summary information.
6. **Table Display**: Renders workflow runs data in a table format with options for column filtering, sorting, and pagination.
7. **Dynamic Data Filtering**: Workflow runs data updates dynamically based on selected workflow, date, and search text.

### Design Decisions:
1. **Component Structure**: Implemented a modular component-based structure for better maintainability and scalability.
2. **State Management**: Utilized React's state management for handling dynamic data and user interactions.
3. **UI Components**: Leveraged UI components from a UI library for consistent and reusable design elements.
4. **Flex-Grid Layout**: Organized cards and table components using a flex-grid layout for better alignment and responsiveness.
5. **Dropdown Menu**: Used dropdown menus for workflow selection and column visibility options to declutter the UI.
6. **Error Handling**: Implemented error handling to gracefully handle cases where selected workflow or date does not have corresponding data.

### Rationale:
1. **Modularity**: The component-based structure allows for easier maintenance and scalability, enabling the addition of new features or modifications with minimal impact on existing code.
2. **User Experience**: Prioritized user experience by providing intuitive interfaces for selecting workflows, dates, and searching for workflow runs.
3. **Consistency**: Maintained consistency in design elements and UI components throughout the dashboard for a cohesive user experience.
4. **Flexibility**: Designed the dashboard to be flexible, allowing users to customize their view by selecting workflows, filtering by dates, and adjusting column visibility.
5. **Performance**: Optimized performance by dynamically updating data based on user interactions, reducing unnecessary rendering and data processing.
6. **Accessibility**: Ensured accessibility by using semantic HTML elements, ARIA attributes, and providing alternative text for non-text elements like emojis.

### Next Steps:
1. **Performance Optimization**: Further optimize performance by implementing server-side pagination and data caching.
2. **Enhanced Data Visualization**: Integrate data visualization tools like charts or graphs to provide more insightful analysis of workflow runs.
3. **User Preferences**: Implement user preferences functionality to allow users to save their preferred settings and layouts.
4. **Internationalization**: Support internationalization to make the dashboard accessible to users from different language backgrounds.
5. **Documentation and Testing**: Create comprehensive documentation and conduct thorough testing to ensure reliability and usability of the dashboard.
